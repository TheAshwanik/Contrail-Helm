# Overview

Contrail Security minimizes risk to applications that run in multicloud environments. It discovers application traffic flows and drastically reduces policy proliferation across different environments. Itâ€™s a fundamental building block of Contrail Enterprise Multicloud.

With Contrail Security, you define policies once and automatically distribute them uniformly across all deployments. You can also use it to easily monitor and troubleshoot traffic flows inside each application and between applications.

An integrated virtual router (vRouter) acts as a distributed element on every host where applications reside, enforcing security and redirecting suspicious traffic to next-generation virtual firewalls as needed.

Contrail Security offers enterprises and software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers the following advantages:

### Consistent, Intent-Driven Policy
Contrail Security streamlines policy creation by helping you define intent. You can use simple terms that enable smart microsegmentation across diverse cloud environments, such as OpenStack, Kubernetes, bare metal servers, and public clouds.

### Multiple Enforcement Points
Contrail Security uses distributed security and networking policies to orchestrate defense and protect applications from threats. For more comprehensive defense to keep your business protected, it integrates with next-generation virtual firewalls to provide advanced security services.

### Application Traffic Visibility and Advanced Analytics
Contrail Security uses application-to-application flow discovery to offer visualization, analytics, and orchestration across multicloud environments, while reducing risk from unauthorized traffic. It provides deep insight into application interactions, using machine learning to detect anomalies and take corrective actions.

### Unified Operations and Management
To ensure connectivity and secure services across multicloud environments, you can operate and manage Contrail Security alongside Contrail Networking using the unified Contrail Command GUI.

Contrail Security is available in the Contrail product family. To help you with your initial implementation and configuration, Juniper Professional Services offers JumpStart Services for Contrail.
